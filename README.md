# Description
Generates a hex-based grid that utilizes perlin noise to create terrain features, regions, continents, and resources.
A simple player system is implemented that generates random types of players.
Player characteristics such as goverment type dictate the full name of the player.
Randomized charcter traits affect the relationships of nearby players.

# Project Updates
## Discontinued
8/15/24 - I plan on discontinuing this project to focus my attention to others. The overall development time was ~8 months. I plan on focusing on developing projects focused on state-machines in order to gain more experience in AI architecture before further developing this project. Once I started working on the AI behvaior I realized all of my methods were unmanagle at scale.

## Perlin Noise System
The below maps are the separate 2D Perlin Noise Maps that are eventually combined to generate the regions (temperature map, rain map), continents, rivers, resources and features, and other terrain characteristics.

## Relationships and Priorities
Icons above each players capital identifies the players current priority based off of the traits of their leaders. These traits impact their base relationship with others
